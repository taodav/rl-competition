== Using This Download ==
Before diving into this, you may want to check out [GettingStarted the getting started guide].

This download can be used to augment your existing local RL-Library (if you have one), or as the basis to start a new one.

=== This Is Your First Project ===
{{{
#Create a directory for your rl-library. Call it whatever you like.
mkdir rl-library
}}}
That's all you have to do special for the *first time* you download a rl-library component.  Continue on now
to the next section.

=== Adding To An Existing RL-Library Download ===

{{{
#First, download the file.  Depending on your platform, you might have to do this manually with a web browser. 

#If you are on Linux, you can use wget which will download $FILENAME$ for you
wget $FILELINK$

#Copy the download to your local rl-library folder (whatever it is called)
cp $FILENAME$ rl-library/
cd rl-library

#This will add any project-specific things necessary to system and products folders
#It will also create a folder for this particular project
tar -zxf $FILENAME$

#Clean up
rm $FILENAME$
}}}
