== Running This Experiment ==
If appropriate, this experiment will automatically recompile itself each time you run it. 

To run it, simple execute the `run.bash` script that was bundled with the project.

{{{
>$ cd $PROJECTDIR$
>$ bash run.bash

}}}

This will start up the agent, environment, and experiment program needed to run this example, and will also start the rl_glue executable socket server if necessary.
