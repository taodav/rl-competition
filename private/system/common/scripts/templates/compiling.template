== Compiling This Project ==
You must have ANT installed to build this project using these instructions.

You don't have to compile this, because the JAR file has been compiled
and placed into the products directory already. However, if you want to 
make changes and recompile, you can simply type:
{{{
>$ cd $PROJECTDIR$
>$ ant clean

#this will update ../products/$JARNAME$
>$ ant $ANTBUILDTARGET$
}}}

== Running This Project ==
You can run this project by typing:
{{{
>$ java -jar products/$JARNAME$
}}}
You can also use it in conjunction with RL-Library by putting the JAR file
products/$JARNAME$ in the appropriate directory, as long as the 
RL-Viz library jar file is in the appropriate relative location from
where you put $JARNAME$.  The location is:
../system/common/libs/rl-viz/RLVizLib.jar
